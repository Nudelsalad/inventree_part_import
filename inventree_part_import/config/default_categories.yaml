# This file should specify all your InvenTree categories, as well as metadata like category aliases, parameters, etc. for them.
#
# It's defined as hierarchical tree structure where every 'node' represents a category.
# Additionally you can define the following meta attributes (starting with _):
#
# _aliases      has to be a list of supplier category names which will be mapped to that category
# _description  specifies the categories description (defaults to category name)
# _ignore       makes inventree_part_import ignore that category, as well as any subcategories
# _parameters   has to be a list of parameter names (for parameters defined in parameters.yaml) this category uses
# _structural   can be set to true to make the category structural
